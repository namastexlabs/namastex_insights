# Installation

Installing Namastex Insights is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few steps. This guide will walk you through the installation procedure, ensuring that you have everything set up correctly to start leveraging the power of AI-driven conversation and art generation in your Discord server.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, you'll need to clone the Namastex Insights repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/namastex-insights.git
```

This will create a local copy of the Namastex Insights codebase on your machine.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd namastex-insights
```

Next, install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager. Namastex Insights uses Poetry for dependency management. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary packages specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Namastex Insights requires certain environment variables to function properly. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following variables:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
STABILITYAI_API_KEY=your_stabilityai_api_key
HONCHO_API_KEY=your_honcho_api_key
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```

Replace `your_anthropic_api_key`, `your_stabilityai_api_key`, `your_honcho_api_key`, and `your_discord_bot_token` with your actual API keys and bot token. Make sure to keep these credentials secure and never share them publicly.

### Step 4: Run the Bot

```

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have now successfully installed Namastex Insights. The bot is ready to engage in intelligent conversation, generate art, and provide personalized experiences for your Discord community.
